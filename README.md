# **Project name:** BigHits (Movie Rentals Web Application)

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of my first projects that I was able to accomplish in my sophomore year with the purpose of learning the nature of framework and to achieve an e-commerce web application with MVC implemantaion. This web appication allows user to create their user credentials such as name, phone, email, etc. As you achieve your login username and password, the varification of user is done by sending the email to the email user have used which needs to be checked forthe access to the movies website. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the verification is completed, user can browse the website that contains nice formatted website used bootstrap and jquery with responsive feature and search option in navigation bar that searches movies directly from the movies datbase. Movies page was rendered using c# and HTML5/CSS from MS SQL server database. CRUD functionality is implemented in order for admin to add or modify the database using webforms and user interface. There is now Cart that calculates the total of each items everytime that you buy items and also allowas you to modify the quantity of items. Finally premitive phase checkout phase is available in this project that asks for checkout credentials.

You can pull or download the project so your vompatible visual studio can acces the right file to open project, once the VS is opeaned you can run your IIS server to execute your localhost from where you can browse the website.

## Usage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
